# locket-sys
The goal of this project is to make a custom timepiece using a Raspberry Pi and E-ink display. It's a work in progress as of the moment, with only a working home page and no other functions. The goal is to create some apps that take advantage of the system having a raspberry pi zero. Things I plan to add are a stopwatch, alarm, TOTP client, Bluetooth beacon, aircrack suite, and Wireshark packet grabber. Once the project has moved along an acceptable amount, I will update this read me with a steps and parts list for other people to make their own.
